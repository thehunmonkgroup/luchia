Lua API for CouchDB (http://couchdb.apache.org).

INSTALLATION:

It is recommended to install the LuaRocks (http://luarocks.org) package
manager, as all required and optional dependencies are easy install via this
method.  Here are the dependencies:

  Requires:
    cjson
    lualogging
    luasocket

  Optional
    stdlib (prettier output for request.lua)
    luadoc (to generate local documentation)
    lunatest (to run unit tests)
    luacov (to view unit test coverage)

Future plans are to add luchia to the main LuaRocks repository, but until
then copy luchia.lua and the luchia directory from the base luchia directory,
and put them somewhere in your Lua package path.

DOCUMENTATION:

Available online at:
  http://thehunmonkgroup.github.com/luchia/modules/luchia.html

For local documentation, all documentation is inline, but is luadoc
(http://keplerproject.github.com/luadoc) compatible. To generate HTML
documentation, install luadoc, enter the base luchia directory, then
run:
  mkdir doc
  /path/to/luadoc -d doc *.lua luchia/*.lua luchia/core/*.lua

If you don't want to go this route, then at least start with the inline
documentation in luchia.lua.

UNIT TESTS:

luchia core classes have full unit test coverage. They can be run with:
  lua /path/to/luchia/tests/run_unit_tests.lua -v

INTEGRATION TESTS:

The higher-level luchia classes (luchia.database, luchia.document,
luchia.utilities) have a full integration test suite, to run it, make sure
that the default server settings in luchia.conf point to a valid, running
CouchDB instance with full administrative access, and run:
  lua /path/to/luchia/tests/run_integration_tests.lua -v
