Lua API for CouchDB (http://couchdb.apache.org).

INSTALLATION:

It is recommended to install the LuaRocks (http://luarocks.org) package
manager, as all required and optional dependencies are easy install via this
method.  Here are the dependencies:

  Requires:
    cjson
    lualogging
    luasocket

  Optional
    luadoc
    stdlib

Future plans are to add luchia to the main LuaRocks repository, but until
then copy luchia.lua and the luchia directory from the base luchia directory,
and put them somewhere in your Lua package path.

DOCUMENTATION:

All documentation is inline, but is luadoc
(http://keplerproject.github.com/luadoc) compatible. To generate HTML
documentation, install luadoc, enter the base luchia directory, then
run:
  mkdir doc
  /path/to/luadoc -d doc *.lua luchia/*.lua luchia/core/*.lua

If you don't want to go this route, then at least start with the inline
documentation in luchia.lua.
