Lua API for CouchDB (http://couchdb.apache.org).

INSTALLATION:

It is recommended to install the LuaRocks (http://luarocks.org) package
manager, as all required and optional dependencies are easy install via this
method.  Here are the dependencies:

  Requires:
    lua-cjson
    lualogging
    luasocket

  Optional
    stdlib (prettier output for luchia_get)
    luadoc (to generate local documentation)
    lunatest (to run unit tests)
    luacov (to view unit test coverage)

With LuaRocks, simply run:
  luarocks install luchia

For manual installation, copy luchia.lua and the luchia directory from the
source directory, and put them somewhere in your Lua package path.

DOCUMENTATION:

Available online at:
  http://thehunmonkgroup.github.com/luchia/modules/luchia.html

For local documentation, all documentation is inline, but is luadoc
(http://keplerproject.github.com/luadoc) compatible. To generate HTML
documentation, install luadoc, enter the source directory, then run:
  /path/to/luadoc -d doc *.lua luchia/*.lua luchia/core/*.lua

If you don't want to go this route, then at least start with the inline
documentation in luchia.lua.

UNIT TESTS:

Luchia core classes have full unit test coverage. They can be run with:
  cd /path/to/luchia/tests
  lua run_unit_tests.lua -v

INTEGRATION TESTS:

The higher-level Luchia classes (luchia.database, luchia.document,
luchia.utilities) have a full integration test suite. To run it, make sure
that the default server settings in luchia.conf point to a valid, running
CouchDB instance with full administrative access, and run:
  cd /path/to/luchia/tests
  lua run_integration_tests.lua -v
